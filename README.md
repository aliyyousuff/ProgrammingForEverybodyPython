# ProgrammingForEverybodyPython
All problems from a Coursera course named 'Programming for Everybody with Python'

Please do not directly copy codes from github and then paste into course's assignment. If do that you lear nothing. Try your own and believe you can do that. If you can solve a problem after spending much time,trust me it gives you feeling kind of ecstasy.


Good Luck
